# node-bins-demo
This is a demo for 'node-bins'.

[node-bins: Fast create global commands by nodejs.](https://github.com/laoer536/node-bins)

1、Clone code or download code zip.

2、run `pnpm install`

3、run `create-bin`

Then you will generate a global 'force-push' command, and you can execute 'force-push <forcePushBranch>' in any directory already managed by git to force the current code to be pushed to the corresponding 'forcePushBranch' branch in the warehouse.



Thant's so cool !☺️
